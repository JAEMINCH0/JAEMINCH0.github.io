Hello! I am a Computer Science M.S. student in my second semester at [Stony Brook University](https://stonybrook.edu/), advised by [Prof. Fran√ßois Rameau](https://rameau-fr.github.io/). Prior to that, I was a research intern at [Korea Electric Power Corporation Research Institute(KEPRI)](https://www.kepri.re.kr:20808/newEng/index) and did B.E. in Electronic Engineering at [Inha University](https://www.inha.ac.kr/)

My primary research focus is to establish a scientific foundation for 3D geometric understanding in computer vision. Concretely, my research interests include: (i) developing **Visual Localization fraemworks** (e.g., scene coordinate regression) that efficiently and accurately map RGB images to 6 DoF poses, and (ii) reconstructing **Explicit 3D/4D Representations** from uncalibrated and unposed cameras (e.g., DUSt3R, MonST3R).

I am open to collaboration opportunities in 3D Vision research or related fields. Please feel free to contact me at [jaemin.cho@stonybrook.edu](mailto:jaemin.cho@stonybrook.edu).
